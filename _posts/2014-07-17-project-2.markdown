description: I have created for the PUC/Apple Developer Academy a tvOS project to show the continuous integration information of our students' projects. The App shows the students members in the selected project with photo and if they are inside the building or if they have already left.</br></br>The App uses the code coverage information and seamless integration of our Mac mini with Xcode Server and students information from the CloudKit.
